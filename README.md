ahk readme.md

I never thought anyone would look at this. If you're reading this, because I linked to it in an application. Understand, nothing in these repos was developed for anyone else's consumption.

Developing some ahk scripts to make me more productive is something I'm proud of. I run minscript.ahk at startup on both my personal and work machines.
